# CS 405 Project 2: Texture + Illumination

Project Description
This project focuses on WebGL rendering techniques, specifically implementing advanced texturing and illumination. The key objectives of the project are:

Handling textures of any size (non-power-of-two textures).
Implementing basic lighting with ambient and diffuse components.
Adding specular lighting to simulate reflective surfaces.
Supporting multiple textures with blending functionality (bonus task).

# Instructions for task 4
I did the 4th task but it works a bit differently. So here are the instructions to make it work :')
1. Run the project
2. Add the first and second texture
3. Then add another second texture
This way both the second textures blend and the slider works fine but not the first and second textures.
